## Dataset for the Semantic Interpretation of Tables in Materials Science Papers
- We address the task of semantic interpretation of tables in materials science papers, that is, to detect entity mentions in table cells and to link them to entities such as material properties and units. Our dataset has annotations for semantic interpretation for all table cells in about 200 polymer articles.
- Data format: PDFanno[[1]](#1)
- To obtain PDFs of papers, you will need to apply to an external organization that manages copyrights. Details will be posted as soon as a procedure is finalized.
